Materials to add list:
Dirt -> Falls down and through water
Water -> Falls down and then sideways when not bound.  
Stone -> Not affected by gravity
Plant -> Grows slowly when above water, burns in fire
Fire -> Burns only plants and propogates as necesary/reasonable
Lava -> Water Physics.  Generates fire when adjacent to Plant.  Becomes Stone on contact with water.
